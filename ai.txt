## Overview

MOTD is an AI assistant you access through email. Register your email address, then send messages to ai@motd.com and receive thoughtful responses in your inbox. It works with any email client on any device.

The AI is powered by Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant. Free accounts use Claude Haiku for fast responses. Paid accounts use Claude Opus 4.5 for deeper, more nuanced conversations.

## How It Works

Step 1: Sign up at motd.com with your email address.

Step 2: Send an email to ai@motd.com with your question or request.

Step 3: Receive an AI-generated response in your inbox.

## Account System

All tiers require registration. Sign up at motd.com with your email address. Your registered email becomes your identity—only emails from that address are processed.

Your personal token address looks like 7086-3612@motd.com where 7086 is your permanent user ID and 3612 is your rotatable PIN.

User ID: A 4-digit permanent identifier. This never changes and is also your webmail login.

PIN: A 4-digit rotatable password. You can rotate this anytime for security. After rotation, both old and new PINs work during a grace period.

Security: Your token address only works when sent from your registered email address. This two-factor approach (token + sender verification) prevents unauthorized use.

Webmail: Paid users can access conversation history at mail.motd.com. Login with your user ID (e.g., 7086@motd.com) and PIN as password.

## Message Limits

Free: 200 word prompts, no attachments. Quoted/forwarded text up to 2,000 words is processed for context.

Standard and Pro: No prompt limits. Attachments up to 200KB are processed. Supports PDFs, images, text files, and common document formats.

Daily limits reset at midnight UTC.

## Response Times

Free: Responses typically arrive in 5-15 seconds (Haiku model).

Standard: 2-minute delay before processing begins, then 10-30 seconds for response (Opus model).

Pro: Instant processing, responses in 10-30 seconds (Opus model).

The delay on Standard tier helps manage server load and ensures Pro users always get priority.

## Privacy

Minimal data. We store your email address for authentication and your messages for conversation context. Conversation history is configurable per account.

No tracking. We don't track you, sell your data, or build advertising profiles.

Your email client. Use whatever email app you already have. Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, or even a terminal.

Email is already private. Unlike chat apps and web services, email works through infrastructure you control.

## For Developers

MOTD works as a simple AI API via email. No SDK, no API keys, no webhook configuration. If you can send email, you can use MOTD.

Automation: Script emails via sendmail, curl with SMTP, or any programming language's mail library. Parse responses from your inbox.

Workflows: Integrate AI into email-based workflows. Forward emails to MOTD for summarization. CC ai@motd.com on threads for analysis.

Example using PHP mail():
```php
mail('7086-3612@motd.com', 'Summarize this', $document_text);
```

Example using sendmail:
```bash
echo "Summarize the key points..." | mail -s "Summary request" 7086-3612@motd.com
```

## Use Cases

Writing help: Proofread this paragraph. Suggest a subject line for this email. Make this more concise.

Brainstorming: Give me 5 names for my podcast. What are the pros and cons of remote work? Help me plan a weekend trip.

Learning: Explain quantum entanglement simply. What's the difference between machine learning and AI? How does email actually work?

Coding: What's wrong with this function? How do I parse JSON in PHP? Explain this regex.

## Technical Details

The service runs on Claude (Haiku for Free, Opus 4.5 for paid tiers). Messages are processed via a custom mail pipeline using Postfix and Dovecot. The self-service portal is built with PHP, Laravel, and Filament.

Infrastructure is hosted in Australia. Email processing typically completes in under 30 seconds for Opus, under 15 seconds for Haiku.

## The MOTD Philosophy

Email has been around since 1971. It's the most universal, interoperable communication protocol on the internet. Every device has an email client. Every person has an email address.

AI shouldn't require installing apps or navigating complex interfaces. MOTD brings AI to the simplest possible interface: the one you already use every day.

Message Of The Day. One email, one response, one conversation at a time.
