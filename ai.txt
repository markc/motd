# MOTD - Message Of The Day

AI assistant via email. No apps, no accounts to manage, no tracking. Just email ai@motd.com and get intelligent responses in your inbox.

Website: https://motd.com
Pricing: https://motd.com/pricing/
How It Works: https://motd.com/how-it-works/

## Overview

MOTD is an AI assistant accessed entirely through email. Send a message to ai@motd.com and receive a thoughtful response in your inbox. Works with any email client on any device—Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, or a terminal.

The AI is powered by Claude, Anthropic's frontier AI models:
- Free plan: Claude Haiku (fast, capable)
- Plus plan: Claude Sonnet 4 (excellent reasoning)
- Pro plan: Claude Opus 4 (most capable)

## Core Principles

**Zero Data Retention**: We process your message, send the response, and store nothing. Your email client is your archive. Nothing on our servers to hack, breach, or subpoena.

**Privacy by Design**: No tracking, no analytics, no advertising profiles. We don't know what you ask or what we answer—only that a message was processed.

**Universal Access**: Email works everywhere. Every device has an email client. Every person has an email address. No apps to install, no accounts to create beyond your existing email.

## Pricing Plans

All prices in AUD. Annual plans include 2 months free.

## Token Authentication

MOTD solves email's authentication problem elegantly. Websites have login forms. APIs have auth headers. Email has nothing built-in. Other services force awkward workarounds—special headers users can't set, or body prefixes that clutter messages.

Our solution: authentication embedded in the email address itself.

**Your Token Address**: Paid users receive an address like 7086-3612@motd.com

- First part (7086): Your permanent user ID, like a username
- Second part (3612): Your rotatable PIN, like a password

**Two-Factor by Design**: Your token only works when sent from your registered email address. Even if someone learns your token address, they cannot use it without also controlling your email account.

**PIN Rotation**: Change your PIN anytime—your user ID stays the same. During a grace period, both old and new PINs work so nothing breaks. Like changing a password, but simpler.

**Universal Compatibility**: Works with any email client, any device, any script that can send mail. No special configuration, no SDK, no headers to set.

## How It Works

Step 1: Sign up at motd.com with your email address (or email admin@motd.com).

Step 2: Free users email ai@motd.com. Paid users email their token address (e.g., 7086-3612@motd.com).

Step 3: Write your question or request in the email body. Subject line becomes part of your prompt.

Step 4: Receive an AI-generated response in your inbox within seconds to minutes.

That's it. Email in, AI out.

## Attachments

All plans support attachments with vision capability:

- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON, XML
- **Code**: Any plain text file

Size limits by plan:
- Free: 500KB
- Plus: 1MB
- Pro: 5MB

Use cases: Screenshot debugging, document summarization, image analysis, code review.

## Response Times

- **Free (Haiku)**: 5-15 seconds typical
- **Plus (Sonnet)**: 10-30 seconds typical
- **Pro (Opus)**: 10-60 seconds typical (more thorough responses)

Response time varies with prompt complexity and current load. Paid plans receive processing priority.

## Privacy and Security

**Zero Retention**: Messages are processed and discarded. We keep only:
- Your registered email address (for authentication)
- A timestamp of each request (for rate limiting)
- Nothing else

**No Conversation History**: Unlike chat interfaces, we don't store your conversations. Your email client's sent/received folders are your only record.

**Sender Verification**: Requests are only processed from your registered email address. Spoofed emails are rejected.

**No Third-Party Sharing**: Your data is never sold, shared, or used for training.

**Australian Infrastructure**: Email processing hosted in Australia under Australian privacy law.

## For Developers

MOTD works as a simple AI API via email. No SDK, no API keys, no OAuth flows, no webhook configuration. If you can send email, you can integrate AI.

### Shell Example

```bash
echo "Summarize the key points of this document..." | mail -s "Summary Request" 7086-3612@motd.com
```

### PHP Example

```php
mail('7086-3612@motd.com', 'Code Review', file_get_contents('script.php'));
```

### Python Example

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

msg = EmailMessage()
msg['To'] = '7086-3612@motd.com'
msg['Subject'] = 'Analyze this data'
msg.set_content(data_to_analyze)

with smtplib.SMTP('localhost') as s:
    s.send_message(msg)
```

### Workflow Integration

- Forward emails to MOTD for summarization
- CC your token address on threads for analysis
- Pipe command output to email for interpretation
- Parse AI responses from your inbox programmatically

### Advantages Over Traditional APIs

- No API keys to secure or rotate
- No OAuth flows to implement
- No rate limit headers to parse
- No SDK dependencies
- No breaking API changes
- Works from any language that can send email
- Works from cron jobs, shell scripts, IoT devices

## Use Cases

**Quick Questions**: Facts, conversions, definitions, calculations.

**Writing Assistance**: Proofreading, tone adjustment, subject line suggestions, making text more concise.

**Research**: Explanations, comparisons, pros/cons analysis, learning new topics.

**Coding Help**: Debugging, code review, regex explanation, algorithm suggestions.

**Document Analysis**: PDF summarization, key point extraction, contract review (Plus/Pro with attachments).

**Brainstorming**: Name ideas, trip planning, decision frameworks, creative prompts.

**Professional**: Email drafting, meeting prep, report summaries, technical writing.

## Technical Architecture

- **Mail Server**: Postfix with Dovecot for IMAP/delivery
- **Filtering**: Sieve rules for routing and rate limiting
- **AI Backend**: Anthropic Claude API (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- **Authentication**: Token-based with sender verification
- **Processing**: Stateless—each message processed independently

## Limitations

- **No Conversation Memory**: Each email is independent. Include context in your message if needed.
- **No Real-Time Data**: AI knowledge has a training cutoff. Cannot browse the web or access current information.
- **Email Latency**: Responses take seconds to minutes, not milliseconds like chat.
- **Attachment Size Limits**: Large files must be split or summarized before sending.
- **Daily Message Limits**: Enforced per plan to manage costs.
